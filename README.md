# Identifying Biomarkers of Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cell Stem Cell-derived RPE Cell Heterogeneity and Transplantation Efficacy

Transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells holds great promise for patients with retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. In-depth characterization of RPE cell product identity and critical quality attributes are needed to enhance efficacy and safety of replacement therapy strategies. Here we characterized an adult RPE stem cell-derived (RPESC-RPE) cell product using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq), assessing functional cell integration in vitro into a mature RPE monolayer and in vivo efficacy by vision rescue in the Royal College of Surgeons rats. scRNA-seq revealed several distinct subpopulations in the RPESC-RPE product, some with progenitor markers. We identified RPE clusters expressing genes associated with in vivo efficacy and increased cell integration capability. Gene expression analysis revealed a lncRNA (TREX) as a predictive marker of in vivo efficacy. TREX knockdown decreased cell integration while overexpression increased integration in vitro and improved vision rescue in the RCS rats.
